## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ui-tests
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Browser Binaries**
   ```bash
   npm run install:browsers
   ```

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests headlessly
npm test

# Run tests with browser UI visible
npm run test:headed

# Run tests with Playwright's interactive UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in debug mode (step through with debugger)
npm run test:debug
```

### Specific Test Execution
```bash
# Run specific test file
npx playwright test adding-todos.spec.ts

# Run specific test by name
npx playwright test --grep "should add multiple todo items"

# Run tests for specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

### Viewing Reports
```bash
# Show HTML test report
npm run test:report
```

## Test Specifications Covered

This automated test suite implements all the test cases from the original markdown specifications:

### 1. Adding Todos (`adding-todos.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Basic todo addition
- ✅ Input field clearing after addition
- ✅ Item ordering (new items added to bottom)
- ✅ Empty todo validation
- ✅ Whitespace handling
- ✅ Special characters and Unicode support
- ✅ Long text handling
- ✅ UI state transitions

### 2. Individual Items (`individual-items.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Marking items as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Visual distinction between states
- ✅ Mixed completion states
- ✅ State persistence through multiple toggles
- ✅ Special character support
- ✅ Long text support

### 3. Counter (`counter.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Correct count with proper grammar (item vs items)
- ✅ Counter visibility rules
- ✅ Only counting incomplete items
- ✅ Updates when items are toggled
- ✅ Edge cases (0 items, 1 item)
- ✅ Dynamic updates during operations

### 4. Editing Todos (`editing-todos.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Edit mode focus management
- ✅ Interface changes during editing
- ✅ Save changes on Enter
- ✅ Cancel changes on Escape
- ✅ Save changes on blur
- ✅ Delete todo with empty text
- ✅ Whitespace trimming
- ✅ Special characters and Unicode
- ✅ Completion status preservation
- ✅ Multiple item editing

### 5. Initial State (`initial-state.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Correct initial display
- ✅ Placeholder text
- ✅ Input focus
- ✅ Hidden sections when empty
- ✅ Document title and structure
- ✅ Info footer content
- ✅ Accessibility attributes
- ✅ State transitions

### 6. Mark All Completed (`mark-all-completed.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Mark all items as completed
- ✅ Mark all items as incomplete
- ✅ Toggle-all state updates
- ✅ Individual item interaction
- ✅ Mixed completion scenarios
- ✅ Counter updates
- ✅ Single item handling
- ✅ Many items handling
- ✅ Visibility rules
- ✅ Correct labeling

### 7. Clear Completed (`clear-completed.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Button visibility rules
- ✅ Remove all completed items
- ✅ Counter updates
- ✅ Button state changes
- ✅ All items completed scenario
- ✅ Order preservation
- ✅ Toggle-all integration
- ✅ Single item handling
- ✅ Rapid operations

### 8. Routing (`routing.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Default filter (all items)
- ✅ Active items filter
- ✅ Completed items filter
- ✅ Filter state maintenance
- ✅ Item visibility updates
- ✅ URL navigation
- ✅ Counter behavior across filters
- ✅ Edge cases (no active/completed items)
- ✅ Clear completed while filtered
- ✅ Toggle-all while filtered
- ✅ Filter links and styling
- ✅ Browser navigation support

## Configuration

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
- **Cross-browser testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Automatic server startup**: Starts the jQuery TodoMVC app automatically
- **Rich reporting**: HTML reports, JUnit XML, JSON output
- **Failure handling**: Screenshots and videos on test failures
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retries in CI environments
- **Parallel execution**: Tests run in parallel for faster execution

### Test Fixtures (`test-fixtures.ts`)
- **TodoPage fixture**: Automatically sets up page object for each test
- **Test data**: Standardized test data for consistent testing
- **Helper functions**: Utilities for common test operations
- **Selectors**: Centralized selector management

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Page Object Model**: All UI interactions are encapsulated in the `TodoPage` class
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test starts with a clean state
3. **Descriptive Test Names**: Test names clearly describe what is being tested
4. **Comprehensive Assertions**: Tests verify both behavior and visual state
5. **Error Handling**: Proper handling of edge cases and error conditions
6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tests run consistently across different browsers
7. **Performance**: Efficient selectors and minimal wait times
8. **Maintainability**: Clean, readable test code with good organization

## CI/CD Integration

The test suite is configured for continuous integration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions configuration
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
  
- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps
  
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test
  
- name: Upload test results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Write/Modify Tests**: Update test files in the `tests/` directory
2. **Run Tests Locally**: Use `npm run test:headed` for development
3. **Debug Issues**: Use `npm run test:debug` for step-by-step debugging
4. **Verify All Browsers**: Run full test suite with `npm test`
5. **Review Reports**: Check `npm run test:report` for detailed results

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create new test files in the `tests/` directory
2. Import test fixtures: `import { test, expect } from '../src/fixtures/test-fixtures'`
3. Use the `todoPage` fixture for page interactions
4. Follow existing naming and structure conventions

### Updating Page Objects
- Modify `src/pages/TodoPage.ts` to add new methods or selectors
- Update `src/fixtures/test-fixtures.ts` for new utilities or test data

### Configuration Changes
- Update `playwright.config.ts` for framework-level changes
- Modify `package.json` for dependency or script updates

This automated test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the TodoMVC application and serves as both a testing tool and living documentation of the application's expected behavior.
