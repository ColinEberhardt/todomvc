> the markdown file in this folder describes a manual test for a web application (hosted on 
http://127.0.0.1:8080). please execute this test, using browser automation via an MCP server (don't write a
 script for this), and let me know the results 

⏺ I'll help you execute the test described in the markdown file. Let me first find and read it.

⏺ Search(pattern: "*.md")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Read(adding_todos.md)
  ⎿  Read 74 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I'll execute the TodoMVC tests using browser automation. Let me start by navigating to the application.

⏺ playwright - Navigate to a URL (MCP)(url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.goto('http://127.0.0.1:8080');
     … +34 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now let me execute each test case:

  Test 1: Basic Todo Addition

⏺ playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", ref: "e5", text: "buy some
                              cheese", submit: true)
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'What needs to be done?' }).fill('buy some cheese');
     … +49 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", ref: "e5", text: "feed the cat",
                              submit: true)
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'What needs to be done?' }).fill('feed the cat');
     … +54 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Test 2 requires a fresh start. Let me reload the page:

⏺ playwright - Navigate to a URL (MCP)(url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.goto('http://127.0.0.1:8080');
     … +30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", ref: "e5", text: "buy some
                              cheese", submit: true)
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'What needs to be done?' }).fill('buy some cheese');
     … +49 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ playwright - Evaluate JavaScript (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", function: "(element) =>
                                         element.value")
  ⎿  Error: ### Result
     Error: page._evaluateFunction: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')
         at eval (eval at evaluate (:290:30), <anonymous>:1:22)

     ### Ran Playwright code
     ```js
     await page.evaluate('(element) => element.value');
     ```

⏺ playwright - Evaluate JavaScript (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", ref: "e5", function:
                                        "(element) => element.value")

     ""
     … +52 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now for Test 3, I'll add two more items to test ordering:

⏺ playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", ref: "e5", text: "feed the cat",
                              submit: true)
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'What needs to be done?' }).fill('feed the cat');
     … +54 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", ref: "e5", text: "book a doctors
                              appointment", submit: true)
  ⎿ ### Ran Playwright code                                                                               
    ```js
    await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'What needs to be done?' }).fill('book a doctors appointment')
    … +60 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ For Test 4, I need to test whitespace trimming. Let me reload:

⏺ playwright - Navigate to a URL (MCP)(url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.goto('http://127.0.0.1:8080');
     … +30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", ref: "e5", text: "   buy some
                              cheese  ", submit: true)
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'What needs to be done?' }).fill('   buy some cheese  ');
     … +49 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ playwright - Evaluate JavaScript (MCP)(element: "todo item text \"buy some cheese\"", ref: "e20", function:
                                        "(element) => element.textContent")
  ⎿  ### Result                                                                                           
     "buy some cheese"
     … +51 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ For Test 5, I need to verify interface visibility. Let me reload to start fresh:

⏺ playwright - Navigate to a URL (MCP)(url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code

     await page.goto('http://127.0.0.1:8080');
     … +30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ playwright - Type text (MCP)(element: "textbox \"What needs to be done?\"", ref: "e5", text: "buy some

  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code                                                                              
     ```js
     await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'What needs to be done?' }).fill('buy some cheese');
     … +49 lines (ctrl+o to expand)
